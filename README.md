# 🎮🧠 PixelPuzzles – An Interactive Pattern Matching Game

**PixelPuzzles** is a hardware-based, interactive pattern matching game designed to enhance **cognitive** and **visual processing skills**. Developed as our **final-year engineering project**, this system integrates **embedded systems**, **custom PCB design**, and **interactive logic algorithms** to create a versatile tool for learning and cognitive development.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

**PixelPuzzles** challenges users to replicate random LED patterns using tactile push buttons. The game provides **real-time feedback** through **visual and auditory cues**, making it both **engaging** and **educational**.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🔲 **8x8 LED Matrix Display** powered by **MAX7219 ICs** for dynamic pattern visualization  
- 🎮 **Push-button interface** for user pattern input  
- 🎛️ **Microcontroller-based logic** (Arduino) for real-time control and feedback  
- 🛠️ **Custom-designed PCB** for compact and efficient hardware integration  
- 📢 **Buzzer and LCD feedback system** for user interaction cues  
- 🔄 **Pattern comparison logic** to validate user input and give feedback

## 📦 Components Used

- **Arduino Uno R3 / Nano**
- **2 x 8x8 LED Matrix displays** (with MAX7219 drivers)
- **Push buttons** (for directional control + pattern submission)
- **LCD Display (16x2)**
- **Buzzer**
- **Custom PCB**
- **Resistors, jumper wires, and connectors**
- **Power supply module**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Random Pattern Generation**: A unique shape is generated on the first LED matrix.
2. **User Interaction**: Players recreate the pattern using push buttons on the second matrix.
3. **Pattern Comparison**: Upon pressing the "Compare" button, the system checks if the user’s pattern matches the generated one.
4. **Feedback**: The system gives audio (buzzer) and visual (LCD message) feedback on whether the pattern matches.
